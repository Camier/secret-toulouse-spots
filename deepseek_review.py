Project Goal: Find rare, abandoned, or difficult-to-access natural spots (waterfalls, caves, ruins, swimming holes) by scraping multiple sources and filtering for relevance.

Please analyze the following code sections and provide specific enhancement suggestions focused on:
1. Performance optimizations for handling 3000+ spots
2. Algorithm improvements for better secret spot detection
3. Data quality enhancements
4. Scalability considerations
5. Code robustness and error handling
