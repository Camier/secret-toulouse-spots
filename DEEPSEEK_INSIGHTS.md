After reviewing the provided code sections, here are specific enhancement suggestions focused on the areas you mentioned:

1. **Performance optimizations for handling 3000+ spots**

   - In `calculate_relevance_score`, avoid using lists with `if` statements inside the loop for scoring as it might lead to multiple iterations over the same data. Instead, use a dictionary or a set to store keywords and check membership in constant time.

     Before:
     ```python
     rarity_keywords = [...]
     description_text = (...).lower()
     for keyword in rarity_keywords:
         if keyword in description_text:
             score += 2
     ```
     After:
     ```python
     rarity_keywords_set = set(rarity_keywords)
     if any(keyword in description_text for keyword in rarity_keywords_set):
         score += 2
     ```

   - In `process_spots_for_map`, use a generator expression instead of creating a new list to convert spots data, as it could save memory when dealing with large datasets.
     Before:
     ```python
     spots_data = [spot_obj for spot in spots]
     ```
     After:
     ```python
     spots_data = (spot_obj for spot in spots)
     ```

   - Use `EXPLAIN` query in SQLite to understand how your queries are executed and optimize them if necessary. For example, adding an index on `latitude`, `longitude`, and other columns used in WHERE clauses could improve performance.

2. **Algorithm improvements for better secret spot detection**

   - In `calculate_relevance_score`, consider adding more relevant keywords related to rare or hidden spots based on user feedback or further analysis of popular secret spots.
   - Implement a learning-to-rank approach using machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Random Forest to improve relevance scoring by considering more complex interactions between features.

3. **Data quality enhancements**

   - In `BaseScraper`, add data validation checks before inserting into the database, such as checking for null values in required fields (`source_url`, `raw_text`, etc.) and ensuring latitude and longitude are within valid ranges.
   - Implement deduplication logic to avoid saving duplicate spots from different sources or with minor variations in coordinates.

4. **Scalability considerations**

   - In `BaseScraper`, consider using a connection pool for SQLite instead of establishing a new connection for each spot saved, which can improve performance when dealing with many spots.
   - Use an async I/O library like `aiohttp` and `asyncpg` to make scraping and database operations asynchronous, allowing better handling of long-running tasks without blocking the main thread.

5. **Code robustness and error handling**

   - In `BaseScraper`, add error handling for getting a database connection by using a try-except block with specific exceptions like `OperationalError`.
   - In all functions, handle potential `ValueError` exceptions when trying to access non-existent keys in dictionaries or perform invalid operations on data types.
   - Implement a centralized logging system with proper log rotation and archival to prevent log files from growing too large and losing important information.

Additional suggestions:

- Consider using a more expressive variable naming convention (e.g., `spot_data` instead of `spot`) for better readability.
- Add docstrings and type hints to your functions and classes to improve code understandability.
- Implement unit tests for your scraping logic, relevance scoring algorithm, and other crucial functionalities to ensure their correctness.

By addressing these suggestions, you can improve the performance, scalability, data quality, and overall robustness of your secret spot discovery project.
