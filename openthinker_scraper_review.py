    prompt = """You are analyzing web scrapers for a project that discovers secret outdoor spots around Toulouse.

Current challenges:
1. Scrapers get detected/blocked after running for extended periods
2. Data from different sources (Reddit, Instagram, OSM) has inconsistent formats
3. Performance degrades when processing thousands of spots
4. Coordinate extraction is hit-or-miss across different text formats

Please analyze this scraper code and provide SPECIFIC, IMPLEMENTABLE solutions for:

1. EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION:
   - Concurrent/parallel scraping strategies
   - Memory-efficient data processing for 3000+ spots
   - Optimal batch sizes for database operations
   - Caching strategies to avoid re-scraping

2. ANTI-DETECTION METHODS:
   - Advanced browser fingerprinting avoidance
   - Request pattern randomization techniques
   - Proxy rotation implementation
   - Session management across scraping runs
   - Behavioral patterns that mimic human users

3. DATA STANDARDIZATION:
   - Unified data schema across all sources
   - Confidence scoring for extracted data
   - Fuzzy matching for duplicate detection
   - Hierarchical location type classification
   - Multi-language content handling (French/English)

Think step-by-step about each optimization and provide concrete code examples.
